# Requirements
## Introduction
1. 
This Advance Calculator project is designed in ‘C’ language. This system is based on a concept to generate the total sum, subtractions, divisions, multiplications, modulus, hcf, prime, and many more. Also, this System makes it easy to calculate different numbers. Here, the user has to input the numbers and the system will display output. Also, you can see the basic features of the scientific calculator in this project. Moreover, this mini project is easy to operate and understand by the users. 

2.
This topic was chosen because it gives me an opportunity to implement efficient data structures and provides me flexibilty to understand multiple C programming concepts.

## Research

Advance calculator saves our time, with the help of calculator we can easily calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, hcf and also check whether the number is prime or not.
Advance calculators are used widely in any situation where quick access to certain mathematicalfunctions is needed. They are also used in situations requiring back-of-the-envelope calculationsof very large numbers, as in some aspects of astronomy,physics,andchemistry.  

## Cost and Features
![Description](Link to Pic)
1. Standard Calculator functionality which offers basic operations and evaluates commands      immediately as they are entered.

2. Scientific Calculator functionality which offers expanded operations and evaluates commands using order of operations.

3. Programmer Calculator functionality which offers common mathematical operations for developers including conversion between common bases.

4. In case of arithmetic it performs Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and modulus.

5. In case of advance option it performs HCF, prime, sum of digits, power of a number and factorial of a number.
